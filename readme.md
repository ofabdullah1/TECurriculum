# Tech Elevator Student Repositories

Welcome to Tech Elevator. This repository will contain your daily homework assignments and will also be your way to turn in assignments once ready.


## Git Workflow

Each day you will need to `git pull upstream main` to pull down any new homework assignments and lecture code.

Whenever you finish your homework, you will need to add and then commit your changes. In order for your changes to make it up to your student repository for grading, you will need to `git push origin main` so that your changes are shared to bitbucket.

A sample step-by-step process uses these 4 command line arguments **from your student repository's main directory**:

1. `git add -A`
2. `git commit -m "Your commit message goes here"`
3. `git pull upstream main`
4. `git push origin main`

---

Remember "add - commit - pull - push"


If you are ever confused about the current status of your repositories, you can type `git status` to learn more about the files remaining to check in, add, or push.

Finally, you can always look at your student repository in git.techelevator.com to see if your code was successfully pushed to the remote repository. Instructors are always willing to assist as well.
