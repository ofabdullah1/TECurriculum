# Server-Side APIs: Part 2 Exercise (C#)

In this exercise, you'll add on to the auctions application you previously worked on. When you first built out the application, you added the ability to list, get, and search auctions by title and current bid. In this exercise, you'll add the ability to update and delete auctions. You'll also need to perform data validation to inform the client of any problems.

## Step One: Open solution and explore starting code

Before you begin, open the `ServersideAPIsPart2Exercise.sln` solution and review it. The code might look familiar to you as it's a continuation of the previous exercise.

### AuctionsController.cs

Note that the `Get()` method now returns a `404` response status code if the auction doesn't exist, and specifically, returns `200` when it does.

### Auction.cs

The `Auction` class no longer has the property `IsValid`. You'll add data validation to the class in this exercise.

### Tests

In the `AuctionApp.Tests` project, you'll find the unit tests for the methods you'll write today. After you complete each step, more tests pass.

Feel free to run the server and test the application in the browser, or in Postman. However, your goal is to make sure all the tests pass.

## Step Two: Modify the `Create()` method

First, work on the `Create()` method in `AuctionsController.cs`. Instead of returning `dao.Create(auction);`, call the method and store the return value in a variable. When you create a new auction, send a status code of `201 Created` back to the client. Remember that you need to send the location of the new resource and the resource itself back with that request.

After you complete this step, the `CreateAuction_ExpectCreated` test passes.

## Step Three: Add auction data validation

To get the `CreateAuction_ExpectBadRequest` test to pass, you'd think you'd need to return `400 Bad Request` if some condition were true. However, you can send a blank title, description, and user, and because there's no data validation, the system creates one.

Add these rules to `Auction.cs`:

- `Title`
  - rule: Required
  - message: "The field `Title` must not be blank."
- `Description`
  - rule: Required
  - message: "The field `Description` must not be blank."
- `User`
  - rule: Required
  - message: "The field `User` must not be blank."
- `CurrentBid`
  - rule: Range
  - message: "The field `CurrentBid` must be greater than 0."

*You don't have to use the same messages as listed, but it's always a good idea to return an informative message back to the user.*

If completed properly, the `CreateAuction_ExpectBadRequest` test now passes.

## Step Four: Implement the `Update()` method

This method updates a specific auction. Passed in as a parameter is an `Auction` object that contains the updated properties.

In `AuctionsController.cs`, create a method named `Update()` that accepts an `Auction`, the auction's ID, and returns the updated `Auction` in an `ActionResult`. Then add the attribute to this method so it responds to `PUT` requests for `/auctions` with a number following it, like `/auctions/7`. This number needs to map to the auction ID that's the method parameter.

This method must also:

* Return an `Auction` from `dao.Update()`, passing it the auction and ID that's passed to the method.
* Be able to respond to the client with the proper status code when it's passed an invalid ID.

After you complete this step, the `UpdateAuction_ExpectOk`, `UpdateAuction_ExpectBadRequest`, and `UpdateAuction_ExpectNotFound` tests pass.

> Note: `UpdateAuction_ExpectBadRequest` only passes if you've implemented the data validation is Step Three.

## Step Five: Implement the `Delete()` method

This method deletes a specific auction.

In `AuctionsController.cs`, create a method named `Delete()` that accepts an `int` and returns an `ActionResult`. Then add the attribute to the method so it responds to `DELETE` requests for `/auctions` with a number following it. This number needs to map to the auction ID that's the method parameter.

This method must also:

* Call `dao.Delete()`, passing it the ID that's passed to the method.
* Send a `204(No Content)` status code back to the client, as the method doesn't return a value.
* Be able to respond to the client with the proper status code when it's passed an invalid auction ID.

If completed properly, the `DeleteAuction_ExpectNoContent` and `DeleteAuction_ExpectNotFound` tests pass.

If you followed the instructions correctly, all tests now pass.
