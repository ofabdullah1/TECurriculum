        The folks at Scamper Shipping like to play a bit
        of virtual poker at lunch, Five Card Draw, no Jokers. The deck
        is represented an array of strings, encoded as:

        * "1-C" through "10-C", "J-C", "Q-C", "K-C"
        * "1-D" through "10-D", "J-D", "Q-D", "K-D"
        * "1-H" through "10-H", "J-H", "Q-H", "K-H"
        * "1-S" through "10-S", "J-S", "Q-S", "K-S"
    
        A hand is made up of a 5 card array. For example:
        ["3-H", "4-D", "10-S", "9-D", "2-S"]
        */

        Given a 5 card array, return the value of the first card.

        GetFirstCard(["3-H", "7-H", "5-H", "8-H", "6-H"]) → "3-H"
        GetFirstCard(["1-C", "1-D", "1-H", "1-S", "2-C"]) → "1-C"

        array made up of the second through fifth cards of the original array.

        the first from the original deck.

        Note: The new array returned is one element shorter than the original,
        except when the deck has no cards. Then the array returned must be empty.
